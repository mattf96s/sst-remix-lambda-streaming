# sst-remix-lambda-streaming

Streaming response from a lambda using Remix with SST.

> Basically copied this [repo](https://github.com/tappleby/remix-aws-streaming-example/tree/main>).

## Limitations

- You have to deploy SST when running locally (haven't checked how this is handled in other frameworks; maybe buffer when running locally?).

- I patched a few things but then prettier did some formatting&mdash;so not as extreme as it looks.

- Also patched to allow ESM while we're at it.
